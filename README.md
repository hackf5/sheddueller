# Sheddueller

**_Sheddueller_** - a .NET 10 task scheduler for applications that need durable background jobs, delayed work, recurring schedules, retries, dynamic concurrency groups, and a small operational dashboard.

**Sheddueller** - someone who duels with sheds. Think _The Big Lebowski_, but with a PC instead of a White Russian, sword-fighting a small and meaner version of _Howl's Moving Castle_.

## Motivation

I like [Hangfire](https://www.hangfire.io/). I've used it in a lot of projects. It sits in that pragmatic small-team space between rolling your own background services and cloudslop enterprise hell.

If what you need is fire-and-forget jobs, delayed jobs, retries, and a useful dashboard, Hangfire is a solid option. I've got a long way with it. The thing I needed for my current project, though, was **concurrency groups**.

A concurrency group is exactly what it sounds like: a group with a maximum number of concurrent jobs. You assign a job to one or more concurrency groups, and that job can only be claimed by a worker when there is a free slot in every group to which it belongs.

In my case, I am ingesting vacation rental data from various sources. Lots of these sources are rate limited, so you can't just enqueue hundreds of data refreshes against them and hope for the best. They will ban you, throttle you, or send a nasty email (if they are French). It's a primitive industry.

By putting all ingestion jobs for a specific API into a single concurrency group, I can ensure that no matter how many workers are running in the cluster, the number of concurrent fetches against that API is bounded by a number I've specified.

[Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/13.x/horizon) has a similar concept, expressed through queues, and it is very useful in practice.

Obviously the `Ghost in a Bottle` has changed things. What would normally be a multi-month nightmare project that I simply couldn't justify becomes a short hack. So Sheddueller also includes a few other things I find annoying when working with background jobs, like not being able to search for jobs easily in the dashboard, and not being able to add diagnostic logging directly to the job view. Sometimes you just want the logs next to the thing that failed. Revolutionary stuff.

This package has not yet been stress tested or battle hardened, so use with caution. I would advise against using it in important production systems until it has been put through its paces.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package Sheddueller
dotnet add package Sheddueller.Postgres
dotnet add package Sheddueller.Worker
```

For a web dashboard:

```bash
dotnet add package Sheddueller.Dashboard
```

For tests:

```bash
dotnet add package Sheddueller.Testing
```

## Configure

Register `AddSheddueller(...)` in processes that only submit work or manage schedules. Register `AddShedduellerWorker(...)` in processes that should also execute jobs.

`WorkerOptions` below is an application options type; the callback can read any service registered with DI.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Options;
using Sheddueller;
using Sheddueller.Postgres;

builder.Services.Configure<WorkerOptions>(
    builder.Configuration.GetSection("Worker"));
builder.Services.AddTransient<EmailJobs>();

builder.Services.AddShedduellerWorker(sheddueller => sheddueller
    .UsePostgres(
        serviceProvider =>
        {
            var configuration = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IConfiguration>();
            return configuration.GetConnectionString("Sheddueller")
                ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("Connection string 'ConnectionStrings:Sheddueller' is required.");
        },
        (serviceProvider, postgres) =>
        {
            var configuration = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IConfiguration>();
            postgres.SchemaName = configuration["Sheddueller:Postgres:SchemaName"] ?? "sheddueller";
        })
    .ConfigureOptions((serviceProvider, options) =>
    {
        var worker = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IOptions<WorkerOptions>>().Value;
        options.NodeId = Environment.MachineName;
        options.MaxConcurrentExecutionsPerNode = worker.MaxConcurrentExecutions;
        options.DefaultRetryPolicy = new RetryPolicy(
            MaxAttempts: 3,
            BackoffKind: RetryBackoffKind.Exponential,
            BaseDelay: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
            MaxDelay: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));
    }));
```

Schema migrations are explicit:

```csharp
await app.ApplyShedduellerPostgresMigrationsAsync();
```

Run migrations during deployment or before starting workers against a new schema. Normal startup validates the configured provider; it does not silently create the schema.

Use `UsePostgres(postgres => postgres.DataSource = dataSource)` when an application needs to share or own a prebuilt `NpgsqlDataSource`; in that mode, the application also owns disposal.

## Enqueue Jobs

Job methods return `Task` or `ValueTask` and receive the scheduler-owned `CancellationToken`. Use constructor-injected `ILogger<T>` for durable job logs, `Job.Context` when a handler needs the job id or attempt number, and scheduler-supplied `IProgress<decimal>` for durable progress updates.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public sealed class EmailJobs(ILogger<EmailJobs> logger)
{
    public async Task SendWelcomeAsync(
        Guid userId,
        IProgress<decimal> progress,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        logger.LogInformation("Sending welcome email for user {UserId}.", userId);
        await SendEmailAsync(userId, cancellationToken);
        progress.Report(100);
    }
}

var jobId = await enqueuer.EnqueueAsync<EmailJobs>(
    (jobs, ct, progress) => jobs.SendWelcomeAsync(userId, progress, ct),
    new JobSubmission(
        Priority: 10,
        ConcurrencyGroupKeys: ["email"],
        RetryPolicy: new RetryPolicy(3, RetryBackoffKind.Exponential, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5)),
        Tags: [new JobTag("email", "send-welcome")]),
    cancellationToken);
```

Sheddueller captures job logs by registering a Microsoft `ILoggerProvider`. If the application uses Serilog as the host logger and still wants Sheddueller's provider to receive log events, enable provider forwarding:

```csharp
builder.Host.UseSerilog(
    (_, _, loggerConfiguration) => loggerConfiguration.WriteTo.Logger(Log.Logger),
    preserveStaticLogger: true,
    writeToProviders: true);
```

Because Sheddueller's capture is a Microsoft `ILoggerProvider`, Microsoft logging filters still apply. Configure `Logging`/`ILoggingBuilder` filters alongside any Serilog filtering rules if you want to control which job logs are stored by Sheddueller.

Use `NotBeforeUtc` for delayed jobs. Use `JobIdempotencyKind.MethodAndArguments` to reuse an existing queued job with the same target method and serialized arguments.

## Recurring Schedules

Recurring schedules are keyed definitions. Calling `CreateOrUpdateAsync` at startup is the intended reconciliation model.

```csharp
await schedules.CreateOrUpdateAsync<EmailJobs>(
    "email:daily-digest",
    "0 2 * * *",
    (jobs, ct, progress) => jobs.SendDailyDigestAsync(progress, ct),
    new RecurringScheduleOptions(
        Priority: 5,
        ConcurrencyGroupKeys: ["email"],
        OverlapMode: RecurringOverlapMode.Skip),
    cancellationToken);
```

Cron expressions use the standard five-field format and are evaluated in UTC.

## Dashboard

```csharp
builder.Services.AddShedduellerDashboard(options =>
{
    options.EventRetention = TimeSpan.FromDays(14);
});

app.UseAntiforgery();
app.MapShedduellerDashboard("/sheddueller");
```

The dashboard uses the configured Sheddueller provider and can be hosted by a worker process or a client-only web process.

## Testing

`Sheddueller.Testing` replaces enqueueing and schedule management with capture-friendly fakes.

```csharp
services.AddShedduellerTesting();

var capture = provider.GetRequiredService<CapturingJobEnqueuer>().Capture();
await subject.DoSomethingThatEnqueuesAsync();

var matches = await capture.Fake.MatchAsync<EmailJobs>(
    (jobs, ct, progress) => jobs.SendWelcomeAsync(userId, progress, ct));
```

The same package includes `FakeJobEnqueuer`, `FakeRecurringScheduleManager`, and async-context-aware capture services for dependency-injected tests.

## Sample

From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
dotnet run --project samples/Sheddueller.SampleHost
```

Open `http://localhost:5000/` for the launcher and `http://localhost:5000/sheddueller` for the dashboard.
